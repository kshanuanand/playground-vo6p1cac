# Presentation

Welcome to this collection of exercises to learn Python in high school.

The purpose of this collection is to group exercises to work independently, in class or at home, in order to gradually learn the Python language. The Python language is now part of the high school mathematics program also in this collection, it will be mainly focused on mathematical exercises using Python and not purely computer exercises (even if there are any).

# How it works ?

The principle is simple: on each page are one or more exercises to do with a statement and presentation of the variables that will be given as input and the outputs that are expected.

Then we find a frame, as below, in which we must type its code. Some of the code is already pre-filled and it is better not to touch the header. For practical reasons, all the input functions are called `my_program` (at least at the beginning) and you do not have to change the name in order to validate the tests. After `my_program`, the variables announced in the Entry section of the exercise statement can be read in parentheses.

To solve the exercise, you have to create a program that will pass the tests when you press Run.

To practice, try to add `print ('Hello World')` in the following program and test it by pressing Run.
We must be careful to shift what we write at the same level as the comments (which begin with #).
